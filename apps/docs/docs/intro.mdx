# Quickstart

NFT.Storage is designed to enable the long-term preservation of NFT data in the decentralized, verifiable Filecoin Network, charging only a small one-time fee. By storing in the Filecoin Network, we strive to ensure that your NFTs are accessible, safeguarding your digital assets without recurring costs.

Our unique approach is designed for longevity through an on-chain endowment, specifically dedicated to covering Filecoin storage costs. This endowment will be managed by smart contracts on the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine, designed to create transparency, trustlessness, and financial sustainability, thereby aiming to ensure your NFTs are protected for the long term.

NFT.Storage is designed with user convenience in mind. Minting platforms can easily integrate, allowing creators to effortlessly store their NFTs. We aim to make the transition to long term storage as straightforward as possible, empowering creators and platforms with easy-to-use tools and services.

In the future weâ€™ll also provide marketplaces with an API to showcase which NFTs utilize NFT.Storage for long term preservation. This builds consumer trust by enabling buyers to identify NFTs that are securely stored and verifiable.

5. Ensure your CSV file follows the specified structure:

- Each row represents a token.
- The CSV file should include columns for token ID and content ID (cid).
- Example structure:

  ```
  tokenID, cid
  1, bafy...
  2, bafz...
  3, bafx...
  ```

6. For JSON format, ensure your data follows this structure:

```
[
  {"cid":"content_id_1", "tokenID":"token_id_1"},
  {"cid":"content_id_2", "tokenID":"token_id_2"},
  {"cid":"content_id_3", "tokenID":"token_id_3"},
  ...
]
```

Replace content_id_X with the Content ID (cid) of each token's content and token_id_X with the corresponding Token ID. Each entry in the JSON array represents a token, with keys "cid" and "tokenID" indicating the cid and tokenID respectively.

7. Once you've selected the files and provided necessary information, initiate the upload process by clicking on **Upload**

Once the upload is complete, you'll be able to view your file in the dashboard
