# Data Retrieval

We're enhancing data retrieval from NFT.Storage through collaboration with our Storage Providers to facilitate access via [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), a part of the decentralized IPFS network. This IPFS public gateway is currently under development to support efficient data retrieval. In the meantime, it's accessible for experimental use at [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/YOUR_CID).

# Retrieval Options

### 1. Less Frequent Retrievals

For less frequent retrievals, you can get your content directly from [Lassie](https://docs.filecoin.io/basics/how-retrieval-works/basic-retrieval) which is a retrieval client for IPFS and Filecoin.

### 2. Frequent, Day-to-Day Retrievals

For more consistent, day-to-day retrieval needs, the IPFS.io gateway may not be suitable due to varying reliability. For a more suitable frequent retrieval use case, we [recommend considering one of these options](https://nft.storage/blog/onboard-nft-data-to-ipfs)
