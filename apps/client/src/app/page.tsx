                      <br /> The following terms and conditions govern all use
                      of the NFT.Storage website (“NFT.Storage” or the

                      other than the NFT.Storage Classic product and

                      of Service available at classic.nft.storage/terms. The
                      Services are offered subject to your acceptance without

                      herein.
                      <br /> If you do not agree to all the terms and conditions

                      continue to apply with all applicable laws in using the
                      Services.

                      In order to store data via the Services, you must first
                      upload it to the IPFS network and obtain a content
                      identifier (CID). Upon specifying a CID, data will be
                      stored on the Filecoin network via the Services. <br />
                      We strive to provide a consistent long-term storage
                      solution for NFT.Storage users. You can find more about

                      . <br />
                      All data uploaded to NFT.Storage is available to anyone
                      who requests it using the correct CID. Users should not
                      store any private or sensitive information in an
                      unencrypted form using NFT.Storage. Further, deleting
                      files from NFT.Storage via the site&#39;s Files page or
                      API will remove them from the file listing for a
                      user&#39;s account, but storage providers on the Filecoin
                      network and/or IPFS nodes that have stored the data may
                      retain copies of the data after you’ve deleted it via
                      NFT.Storage, and smart contracts to renew the storage
                      deals on the Filecoin network may be irreversible. Users
                      should not use NFT.Storage to store data that may need to
                      be permanently deleted in the future. <br />
                      By using the Services, you certify that you own the

                      upload any files you upload via the Services. We reserve

                      Data stored via the Services is pushed to storage on

                      be a delay between content being uploaded via the Services
                      and being stored on Filecoin through a deal.
                      <br /> The Services do not include payments for Filecoin
                      retrieval deals, or for IPFS pinning. You are responsible
                      for paying for any Filecoin retrieval services or IPFS
                      pinning services to the extent you use them.

                      Billing.
                      <br /> In order to store data via the Services, you will
                      need to pay a one-time fee per GB of data to access
                      storage via the Services (the “Paid Plan.”) You can find
                      our pricing information at this link: nft.storage/pricing.
                      To enter into the Paid Plan and receive access to storage
                      via the Services, you will need to provide us with one or
                      more Payment Methods. &#34;Payment Method&#34; means a
                      current, valid method of payment, which may involve a
                      third party or payment processing vendor (such as Stripe),
                      in which case you will also be subject to that third
                      party’s terms and conditions. Payments made via the Paid
                      Plan are one-time fees per GB of data, are nonrefundable,
                      and the resulting storage must be activated within one
                      year of payment. <br /> You agree that you’ll pay the
                      amounts set forth in nft.storage/pricing (the “Fees”) for
                      each billing cycle.
                      <br /> You authorize us to charge any Payment Method
                      associated with your account in case your primary Payment
                      Method is declined or no longer available to us for
                      payment of Fees you owe us. You remain responsible for any
                      uncollected Fees. If a payment is not successfully
                      settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or
                      otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may
                      remove data from any of our hosted systems. For some
                      Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you additional
                      fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees
                      relating to the processing of your Payment Method.
                      <br />
                      Changes.
                      <br /> We reserve the right to change our Paid Plan or
                      adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof
                      in any manner and at any time, in our sole discretion and
                      without notice. If we adjust the pricing of the Paid Plan,
                      we will provide you with at least fourteen (14) days’
                      notice before these changes take effect. By continuing to

                      you’re responsible for any applicable Taxes, and that you
                      will provide us with any applicable tax identification
                      information that we may require by law to ensure our

                      This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the state
                      of Delaware without regard to conflict of law principles.
                      <br />
                      To the extent you provide any ideas, suggestions, or other
                      feedback to us regarding the Services (“Feedback”) you
                      hereby grant us all rights, titles, and interests (such as
                      intellectual property rights) to that Feedback.
                      <br /> You are responsible for maintaining the
                      confidentiality of all usernames, passwords, and other
                      access credentials created by or assigned by you, and are
                      solely responsible for all activities that occur with such
                      credentials. If you permit third-parties to use your
                      credentials to access the Services, you do so at your sole
                      risk and we will not be directly or indirectly responsible
                      or liable to you in any manner for any damages, harms,
                      losses, or claims arising out of or in connection with
                      such permission of your credentials.
                      <br /> If you are on any U.S. or E.U. sanctions list, or
                      residing in any U.S. or E.U.-sanctioned region, you may
                      not use the Services. You agree that you will not access
                      the Services using any technology to circumvent applicable
                      laws, such as sanctions laws.
                      <br /> In order to use the Services you must be 13 years
                      of age or older. If you are 13 or older but under 18 years
                      of age, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s
                      permission to use NFT.Storage and to accept the terms of
                      this TOS.
                      <br /> You may have access to third-party websites and
                      webpages through the Services, and you take full
                      responsibility for your use of those third-party sites
                      which fall outside the scope and control of the Services.
                      We have not reviewed those third-party websites, do not
                      have control over them, do not endorse them, and are not
                      responsible for their contents or their use.
                      <br /> To the extent the Services are dependent on
                      services hosted or operated by third-parties, including
                      payment processors or independent storage networks, we are
                      not responsible for any outages or disruptions caused by
                      those third-parties, such as storage networks or payment
                      processors unexpectedly going offline.
                      <br /> TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW (A) YOU
                      ASSUME ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS, EXPENSES OR
                      OTHER COSTS (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ATTORNEYS’
                      FEES) YOU SUFFER OR INCUR AS A RESULT OF THIRD-PARTY
                      CLAIMS RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, (B) YOU
                      ASSUME ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
                      INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, AND (C)
                      YOUR MAXIMUM AGGREGATE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN
                      CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES SHALL BE LIMITED TO $100,
                      REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE. <br />
                      This Agreement constitutes the entire and exclusive
                      understanding and agreement between you and us regarding
                      your use of and access to the Services. You may not assign
                      or transfer this Agreement or your rights hereunder, in
                      whole or in part, without our prior written consent. We
                      may assign this Agreement at any time without notice. The
                      failure to require performance of any provision will not
                      affect our right to require performance at any time
                      thereafter, nor will a waiver of any breach or default of
                      this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement
                      constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or
                      a waiver of the provision itself. <br />
                      In the event that any part of this Agreement is held to be
                      invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be
                      given effect to the greatest extent possible and the
                      remaining parts will remain in full force and effect.
